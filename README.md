# MIS 584 Business Intelligence
### FinalProject SpecialTees
The client company, Special Tees, is interested in moving beyond the “child” phase of Business Intelligence (BI) maturity, which they are currently at. Thus, our main goal in this project is to assess and implement potential BI solution at Special Tees.
we proposed a new BI solution for our client company ‘Special Tees’ to help them get insights about seasonal staffing, inventory 
orders, customer preferences, etc., 
Created two dashboards, Sales (dashboard for analyzing the sales data across all product types and all serviced locations) and 
Customer complaints (understanding customer complaints, their origins, and how effective the sample company is at solving 
them) with Tableau and built a prototype predictive model.
